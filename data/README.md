You can automatically download the dataset using the `download_dataset.sh` script in the main directory, otherwise, please see below.

Please download our dataset from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/michaelmunje/SocialNav-SUB). This dataset contains the prompt data and human labels for the same social navigation scenarios that the VLMs are evaluated in, which allows quantitative evaluation against human data. Please provide place the dataset in this folder. For example, the human_labels should be located in SocialNavSUB/data/human_labels (unless otherwise specified within your configuration file).
