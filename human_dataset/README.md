# Dataset for SocialNav-SUB

Please download our dataset from [HuggingFace](link) (will add real link later). This dataset contains human labels for the same social navigation scenarios that the VLMs are evaluated in, which allows quantitative evaluation against human data. Please provide place the `human_data` in this folder (and add the prompt data to `prompts/`) or make a custom folder and replace the `dataset_folder` entry in the config file.
